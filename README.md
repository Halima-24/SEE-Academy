Fun Calculator ðŸŽ‰
Welcome to the Fun Calculator â€” a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with a splash of personality!

Features
Adds two numbers (sum)

Subtracts the second number from the first (difference)

Multiplies two numbers (product)

Divides the first number by the second (quotient)

How It Works
The program prompts you to enter the first number (decimal numbers allowed).

Then, it asks for the second number.

It calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those two numbers.

It prints out all the results clearly.

Usage
Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

Save the script to a file, e.g., fun_calculator.py.

Run the script from your terminal or command prompt:

bash
python fun_calculator.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter two numbers.

View the results instantly!

Notes
The program uses float() to accept decimal inputs.

Warning: Dividing by zero is not handled, so avoid entering zero as the second number to prevent errors.

Feel free to enhance the program by adding input validation or extra functionality!

Example
text
Enter the first number: 12.5
Enter the second number: 3.5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 16.0
Difference: 9.0
Product: 43.75
Quotient: 3.5714285714285716
